Software Licensing Information
------------------------------

All the software included in this project is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.  The parts which fall under the copyright
of Plastic Logic Limited (PL) were directly made available under these terms.
Other parts of the software provided by Texas Instrument Incorporated (TI) for
MSP430 hardware support and the FatFs component under the copyright of ChaN
have licensing terms which are compatible with the terms of GPL v3, so they
effectively all fall into the same GPL v3 terms.


About LGPL v3
-------------

This project is effectively a monolithic programme and entirely statically
linked, so the extra clauses of GNU Lesser General Public license v3 do not
apply to any of this software.


IMPORTANT: Derivative works
---------------------------

Any derivative work based on any file present in this project have to follow
the terms of the GPL v3 license; in particular they need to remain under the
GPL v3.

Please note that the licensing terms of the code under TI copyright include an
extra specific clause which is still compatible with the terms of the GPL v3:

  Neither the name of Texas Instruments Incorporated nor the names of
  its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived
  from this software without specific prior written permission.
