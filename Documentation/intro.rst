Introduction
============

This document provides an introduction and overview to the code intended to be used by customers
wishing to drive Plastic Logic displays and associated controller hardware from a single chip microcontroller
platform. The MSP430 is the first reference target, based on customer interest.
As delivered the code runs on a hardware reference platform, available from Plastic Logic, comprising a
microcontroller processor board, a motherboard and display interface boards for a range of displays. The
code runs a slide show demonstration to show how the hardware components work together to drive
images on a display.
The code requires no underlying operating system to function. Some commonly available C runtime library
functions are used.
The project is in active development and feedback is welcomed on new features or issues found in the code
or documentation. Please send feedback via your sales/support representative.

Scope
=====

This document does not attempt to describe the detailed operation of any particular microcontroller or
Epson display controller as this information is readily available, or may require an NDA to disclose. Prior
experience with embedded programming is expected and discussion will focus on the specifics of this code
base.
The code is able to drive a slideshow of pre-rendered images in the PGM file format to a chosen
display.  Due to restrictions on resources the code is not currently able to manipulate the images in any
way.
The code focusses on functionality and does not pretend to implement best practice for any specific
microcontroller. Data transfer speed improvements are planned for subsequent
releases.
The code attempts to strike a balance between minimising microcontroller resource usage while preserving
portability, good coding practices and the provision of good debug support (e.g. use of assertions).
